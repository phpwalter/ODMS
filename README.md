# ODMS
The OpenAPI-Driven Mock Server (ODMS) is a deterministic request execution engine designed to transform OpenAPI 3.1 specifications into authoritative, executable programs. It acts as a "Digital Twin" of an API, allowing frontend and QA teams to develop and test against a high-fidelity mock without a live backend.
